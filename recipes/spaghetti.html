        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This spaghetti and meatballs recipe can be found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAm3Ie9mNo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Youtube</a> by Joshua Weissman, alongside more detailed steps and ingredients. This recipe required you to make your own meatballs which were very tasty. The inclusion of the basil and parmesan toppings really elevated the dish and is one I will most likely make again. I did not, however, make my own spaghetti.</p>
